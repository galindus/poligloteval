"During this period, the modern concept of photographic reporting, differentiated from photojournalism[n. 2] and documentary photography,[n. 3] was consolidated in terms of scope and concept. The photographic reportage involves more the idea of story: a work that wants more time, an effort to interpret a situation and culminates in a set of images. This implies, on the one hand, the claim of the photographer to give his opinion, which will give him author status; the author proposes, therefore, an interpretation of reality. On the other hand, the consensus established among most photographers is that the natural vehicle of the photographic image is the printed page, which supposes that Paris, like this maximum period, Epoclendor, or Paris.

"First, comparing the two texts can be appreciated as the idea of what is meant by a full and successful life has not changed so much since the time of Jane Austen until today.[35] At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the goal of a woman was not to have a career. In fact, at that time, women could hardly study. They only received classes of dance, piano and little else. A situation that could leave them in misery if they did not get a good marriage that guaranteed some economic well-being. In this way, one can understand the importance of marriage that reveals Jane Austen to Pride and Prejudices.

It is also one of the easiest frogs to care for: its diet is varied and very resistant to disease. One problem often associated with breeding this frog is overfeeding; giant reinetes tend to get obese if they are given too much food. In the wild, frogs spend energy to capture prey, but in captivity they generally live in a restricted space. This reduces the activity needed to feed, resulting in a weight of this thickened body with the ""libass-like appearance"".

Therefore, in dissolution there are more particles than those that have been dissolved, since these are broken, they are dissociated, in smaller parts.

These cells are located in the hypothalamus, in the arteries and elsewhere. Through these cells the organism can regulate the concentration of salts in their fluids, osmolality.[15] In humans are osmoreceptors the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. Through antidiuretic hormones (vasopressin or ADH, pitressin), the osmoreceptors detect the diurism to maintain the pressure of the corresponding to the blood in a variation only 28/5 mogmols.[16]

"A third theory explains the osmosis from the decrease in vapor pressure, which results in the solvent distilling across the membrane until both pressures are equal. If we apply a pressure equal to the osmotic pressure of the solution, distillation will stop, and we would need a higher pressure to reverse the direction.[11][9] The solvent flux through a semipermeable membrane is analogous to the solvent flux in the vapor phase that occurs if samples of the solvent and a solution are left inside a closed container. Since the vapor pressure of the solvent is higher, a net transfer of solvent to the solvent flux occurs to the solvent's flux.[12] The solution has continued to the solution.

However, there are a large number of species, both the fluid that surrounds the cell and the fluid or cellular cytoplasm, which can not cross the membrane. If the total concentration of this solutes is greater in the fluid that surrounds the cell, it will lose water by osmosis and it is said that the surrounding fluid is hypertonic with respect to the cell fluid (has greater osmotic pressure).

"Vegetables use the osmotic pressure to move water through the xylem from the roots to the leaves. This has been proven in the maples when spring begins and the movement of sap begins. The roots have a high concentration of sugars produced during the summer and stored in the roots. When the snow melts, water reaches the roots in large quantities and enters them, by the absorbent hairs, by effect of osmotic pressure and causes the sap to rise to the leaves. But in most vegetables it is not possible to explain the rise of the sap by means of pressure or to the leaves, as well as transpired, occurs in the leaves.[17]

"On the coins of the 5th and 4th centuries BC, a leather cap with earmuffs and a particular curly knot protector are seen under the Corinthian helmet. This element seems key to the analysis of the leather helmet. The most complete example is a Athenian vessel where Hector appears with a Corinthian helmet on a leather cap with earmuffs and a curly knot protector. This element would be very important in order to reconstruct the interpretation of the statue, because the leather cap is the sign that distinguishes the strategists, the general of the army from a Greek polis. The Bronze B has been characterized by recognizing it as an armed commander.

It was said that they could be laurel branches, a sword or a spear, which recognizes the hand signals for the insertion of a rope that is used to increase the propulsion and the accuracy of the weapon. This hypothesis, however, diminishes when the sources clearly point to the scant consideration that the warrior's talent for the throwing weapons would have had. It would be unlikely that the sculptor would show a diminished figure in his dignity, as if it were a javelin thrower, who played an important role in the Pellitic battle.

Rather, they are archetypal representations and their design changed over the course of the centuries, as with the insignia of the portrayed kings. Elephant tusks with figurative carvings, probably begun to be used as a decorative element in the 18th century, show concrete scenes that characterize the reign of a deceased king.[26]

"Benin's sculpture is more naturalistic than most totems in Africa.[24] The bronze surfaces are designed to look for contrasts with the wound of light on the metal, noticeable in copper bracelets, bronze armour, and background decorations, which highlight the torsos of the squashed figures. The traits of the heads are accentuated away from the natural proportions and the artist makes them much larger, exaggerating the modeling of the eyes, nose and lips, which he draws with great care.[25] The most notable of the pieces is the high level of skill that the blacksmiths attained from the possibly 13th century's cast artisans,[24] still learned from the vanished art of the vanished Arabs.[25]

"Efforts have been made in the sculpture for a restoration of the highest quality and respecting the original work. Thus, in the version that is preserved in the museum of Olympia, Hermes does not have the classic attributes of wearing a petasos,[15] in the head, or to go footwear with winged sandals. The ornament of an ivy crown seems the most likely.[16] With the left hand, he held another attribute: probably a caduceus. In general, the right arm up to Hermes that is missing, has suggested several interpretations.

This technique offered him a new process for the generation of images from paper fragments. The result is an enigmatic language, which recalls the primitive marks of cave painting or children’s drawings and which, at times, was misinterpreted as abstract, an affiliation that the artist always rejected. Miró explained this process in 1948 in an interview with James Johnson Sweeney: «I used to cut newspapers in non-regular forms and to paste them on paper sheets, day after day I accumulated these forms.

"During the Renaissance and the modern age, sieges dominated the form of war in Europe to the point that Leonardo da Vinci, for example, gained much of its renown by designing fortifications in his study. Medieval campaigns were generally designed through a succession of sieges. However, in the Napoleonic era, the increasing use of very powerful guns was reducing the value of the fortifications, so that already in modern times, the trenches replaced the walls, and the bunkers replaced the castles. Already in the twentieth century the importance of the classic siege was declining due to the arrival of mobile war. A concrete concrete fortification was left as it was so decisive, and this was not so much so that they were before the main means of war, and they were so important, that they were not so much to be able to be so much in the main means of war.

"This type of attitude was a common practice in many armies. A city that surrendered could often be negotiated to avoid plunder. A city that was taken by a siege or by assault could suffer tremendous consequences, even during the 19th century. The brutal pillaging of Jerusalem[15][16] at the end of the First Crusade was often used as a sign of Christian religious fanaticism of the time and barbarism against the Muslims, but deep down it was no different from the end of this type of siege. Jerusalem had been taken to the assault, as Visby in 1361, and the custom was that it could be plundered for three days and three nights, and the inhabitants could be raped or inaded without any kind, but more common, if they were to be held to the city without great tribute.

"A very important element of the siege strategy was whether or not the surrender of the besieged city was allowed. It was usually preferable to allow surrender, both to avoid casualties and to set an example to future besieged cities. Letting a city surrender, with a small cost in lives, was a much better solution than brutally slaughtering the population after a long siege. What is more, if an army had a reputation of killing and plundering without valuing surrender, then the defensive efforts of other cities increased.

"Otello was Rossini’s second serious opera written for Naples. He began work on it in May 1816 at the latest; in any case, he wrote to his mother about the 15th of May: “It will be wonderful and will improve my reputation; and it is entirely possible that it will open the gates of heaven for me.” A few days later, he even announced a date for the first performance that was expected to be during the first days of July. But it ended in nothing, because Rossini suddenly began to work on La gazzetta. For the end of August he restarted the works of Otello. For letters to his mother we know that the opera was possibly ending in contrast with the opera’s ending it with the third performance of his work being written by Rossini’s written down there, and that it was only the fact that he was going to find it in his last five days of a single-day’s liberated from his work.[...]

"The genre of the farce, rather than a comic opera, should be considered as a resource of one act that served as a ""filling"" between the acts of a serious opera, although at Rossini's time this origin had been almost completely lost. The Teatro San Moisè specialized in the farce and, as a rule, presented two in a single night. In any case, L'inganno felice is not a comic opera, but a semiseria of one act, and is the precursor of Torvaldo e Dorliska and Matilde di Shabran, as well as its most well-known semiseria, Lagadrazza.

"Little is known about the genesis of L'inganno felice. It is Rossini's third opera to be premiered and the second farce he wrote for Antonio Cera, the impresario of the Teatro San Moisè in Venice.[1] The success obtained by La cambiale di matrimonio in 1810 had persuaded Cera to offer the promising young composer another commission, this time for the most important 1811-1812 carnival season. Rossini had little time to write it, as the premiere of L'equivoco stravagante had been made only a few weeks earlier, in Bologna. Among the five fares written by Rossini, L'aningno is the felice of those great operas, but it is often performed alongside those great operas.[1]

"During the Oligocene, the crust that had been subducted millions of years earlier in the Alpine region began to rise again. This caused an ascent of the thick continental crust that in the Miocene would cause an extension. In the case of the Alps, this extension could only take place in a west-east direction, since the Adriatic plate still converged in the south. A huge impulse zone was developed that would later become the periadriatic line. The area also included dextral shear resulting from the west-east extension. With the exception of the Austroalpine allochthon material, this impulse evolved to the boundary of the central and European plates. The Fine Hen regions of the Alps were now cpulent and the window of the Taurones.

"Despite a brief increase in temperatures at the end of the Rupelian, during the Oligocene the cooling started by an event that took place about fifty million years ago: the Azolla event. Large amounts of the freshwater fern Azolla grew in the Arctic Ocean. As they sank into the seabed, plants were incorporated into the sediments, where they did not decompose due to the low level of oxygen in the deep water layers.[12] The resulting reduction in the amount of carbon in the Earth's atmosphere contributed to transforming the planet from a ""greenhouse"", enough for them to thrive from the current ice-bearing and ice-bearing,[11] the combination of the planet's gradual ice-bearing ice-bearing effects on the Earth's ice-bearing ice-bearing ice-bearing ice-bearing ice-browing event.[12]

"The political system par excellence of the old regime was absolutism.[6] The various European monarchies tried to concentrate in their hands all the power to make laws, to govern and to execute. To do this they tried not to gather the parliamentary institutions of medieval origin. It was the French monarchy that reached the highest degree of absolutism. In any case, it is necessary to take into account that in practice the political system in each country could vary greatly according to the weight of its customs and the strength of the monarchy. For example in England this struggle led to the English Revolution, which escaped the traditional monarchy for eleven years. Another example until 1714 were the countries of the crown of Aragon, where they had to take the most political decisions (which depended on this oneself, the most important political system).[6]

"The mammoth tubes, an example of sexual dimorphism because they were larger in males than in females, were adapted for fighting between males. They fought for females in which they tried to injure the opponent's vulnerable parts of the shoulder and thorax through their tusks. It is likely that the possibility of being seriously injured meant that there were no unequal fighting. One known case is that two mammoths were so equal that their tusks were stuck with each other and, unable to separate, both mammoths starved to death.[8]

"The first Western expedition to Siberia to study the enormous bones found was that of the British anatomist Hans Sloane, who in 1728 examined fossil remains of teeth and tusks and determined that they belonged to an elephant species. To explain the presence of tropical animals at such high latitudes, he suggested that their extinction was due to enormous climatic change and the Universal Flood. Ten years later, Philosophical Magazine published the work of the German Johann Breyne, including his analysis of fossils and illustrations presented to him by Daniel Messerschmidt. Breyne corroborated the theory of Sanlobodies belonging to proscidial types.[8]

This egg would be inserted into the uterus of an Asian elephant female and, if the process were successful, twenty-two months later a mammoth breeding would be born.

They were usually done in pairs (one of the two farces could be replaced by an extrapolated act of a dramma giocoso in two acts) and were usually interrupted by two dances, one in the middle and another at the end of the show, and sometimes they were replaced by intermonies, especially with the carnivals and improvisations.

"In 1929, the young German art dealer Francis Matthieson compiled on commission from the Soviet government a list of the one hundred existing paintings in Russian collections that should never be sold under any circumstances. He was very surprised to see some of these paintings soon after in Paris in the hands of Calouste Gulbenkian, an oil merchant who had negotiated with the Russians. Gulbenkian wanted him to be his agent in other purchases but Matthieson instead formed a consortium with Colnaghi of London and Knoedler &amp; cia. of New York, which in 1930 and 1931 bought twenty-one paintings from the Russians, which were later sold to the magnifices of Melon, whose of Washington, together with the most important Art Gallery, and Knoedler [12] who donatedler &amp; and Knoedler &amp; &amp; &amp;.

"The horn-oeil technique consists of creating a three-dimensional optical illusion by mixing the scene with the frame or the support that contains it. This technique was widely used from the 17th century, although it can be seen in some 15th century Gothic painters such as Masaccio, Petrus Christus or Jan van Eyck. It is quite innovative to use this technique in the middle of the 14th century. Specifically, Bassa applies a slight brushstroke of white at the base of the inner circle and at the top of the outer circle of the candles of the wall where the door is, simulating a reflection of light that contributes to the frame and creates a perspective in which the characters look like a window behind the left, Aquads of the frame is used to create a similarly to the frame of the same.

"In 1966, Bergman retakes the manuscript he had sketched in the summer of 1965, The Cannibals, which after having restructured it, was born the semi-terror film Vargtimmen (The Wolf's Time). Vargtimmen (1968) is in the Persona line, an intimate film centered on two characters, in this case a woman and a man, isolated on an island. The weight is carried mainly by the male character, the artist, whose director makes us see the phantasmagorias and the turpitudes.

It was painted between 1503 and 1506; it is an oil on poplar panel of 77 × 53 cm[5] retouched several times by the author.[6] The technique used was the sfumato (sfumato), a very characteristic procedure of Leonardo.[8] The painting is owned by the French government and displayed in the Louvre of Paris's Lougitra, with the title of Gis Gondo-herit, and is optimally reworked to verify the process of Louard.[7]

The young poets, writers, artists, students, all wanted to follow the new literary style that definitively broke with the classic rules, among them the rule of the ""three units"" (time, place and argument). Victor Hugo, was of course, to leave the authors to have a place between them to spend the last act of Aemani and Amán, as a place in Spain.[8]

During the premiere, a few problems arose. Verdi complained bitterly of not having singers who simply knew how to sing.[3] In addition, the sets were not ready and had to improvise with what they had. Despite the absurdities, the audience applauded all the passages and Verdi was called to the finale in the first decadence of Verdi, for the mass of Verdi's.[4]

"A life for the Tsar recounts the historical fact of the self-immolation in 1613 of the intrepid peasant Ivan Sussanin to prevent the Polish army from killing Michael I, the first tsar of the newly elected Romanov dynasty at the age of sixteen by the Assembly of the Boyars. A fact that had been engraved in popular memory for centuries and that had again awakened in the conscience of the Russian people with the Patriotic War of 1812.

During the campaigns against Napoleon initiated in 1812, the officers of the army of Tsar Alexander I, the man who had led his armies from Moscow to Paris, had become familiar with many European reformist ideas, and therefore, liberal and dangerous in the eyes of the old nobility. Some officials dreamed of a constitutional monarchy, others of a republic, and many with the emancipation of the serfs, but upon the death of Alexander I in 1825, the new Tsar Nicholas I responded with the most modern reign of Russians and with the most abhorical repression of Russia—theism—which they had lost the most of their own military—incentricity—inous—intogencies of their own rule—intogencies of the republic's—inability—with their own—inability—inability—inability to the republic's—inability—inability—and their own—and their own—and their own—and their own—and their own—and their own

"From the 18th century it was not unusual for Neapolitan composers (such as Cimarosa and Paisiello) to work outside Italy, and Mercadante also spent part of his career abroad. Conditions between Spain and Portugal were very different: while in Portugal Italian opera was firmly established as a high culture, in Spain, which had its own important singing and theatre traditions, it was practiced only on rare occasions and in 1797 was even completely prohibited.

"To use it as its own mausoleum, the emperor Constantine built the old church of the Holy Apostles at the highest point of the city of Constantinople, next to the walls. This mausoleum was replaced by a new church in the time of Justinian I and later by a mosque in 1469, so that currently nothing remains of the primitive mausoleum. The description is found in the work of Vita Constantini [de] and a more circular plan was made by the three emperors. This was a panegyric (more than a biography) of Eusebius of Caesarea. It had a Greek cross; the arm that corresponded to the long entrance was installed to the phallus with the three more circular signs.

"With Constantine converting to Christianity, its leaders – pope, bishops and clergy in general – occupied positions within Roman society as carriers of the new religion of the state. At the same time, Christian architecture went from simple refuge in private houses to new monumental forms inspired by Roman architecture, with the necessary changes when the buildings were taken advantage of previous Roman constructions, for their application to the new functions of the cults of religion: altar for the celebration of mass, narthex for the catechumens, etc. The new religion needed more and increasingly large places of worship, since, day by day, the number of believers increased.[18] Despite the great number of the churches that were built during the fourth century, many were already destroyed,[19].

"Expressionist music sought the creation of a new musical language, releasing the music, without tonality, allowing the notes to flow freely, without the intervention of the composer. In classical music, the harmony was based on the tonic-subdominant-dominant-tonic cadence, without strange notes being given in the scale. However, since Wagner, the sonority had greater relevance with respect to the harmony, gaining importance the twelve notes of the scale.

Thus, the Expressionists used line and color in a temperamental and emotional way, with strong symbolic content. This reaction to Impressionism represented a strong break with art made by the preceding generation, and made expressionism a synonym of modern art during the early years of the twentieth century.[7] Expressionism supplanted a new concept of art, understood as a disembodied by the existence of the Anglicism, and the translimaticism, and the expression of the an element of the an art that was to be in the general form of the an element of the an element of the evolution of the an element of anarchicity of the an art, and expression of the evolution of its own existence.[citation]

Also noteworthy is the importance given to music, which is usually assimilated to color, something that made it easier to transition from figurative art to a more abstract one.[61] Similarly, in his theoretical essays they showed a predilect for the abstract form, in which they saw a large and wide psychological theory, which Kandinsky was an abstract expression of art, and which was an abstract expression of the world, and which he believed to be an abstract artwork.[56].

"The hydrodynamic wind at the top of a planet's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as hydrogen to climb to the exobase, the lower limit of the exosphere, where gases can reach escape velocity, exiting into outer space without impacting with other gas particles. This type of gas loss from a planet in space is known as the planetary wind.[146] Over geological time, this process causes water-rich planets such as Earth to evolve into planets such as Venus over billions of years.[147] Planets that have a low hot atmosphere may have wet atmospheres that accelerate hydrogen loss.[148]

"Wind also limits tree growth. On the coast and isolated mountains, the tree line is usually much lower than at the same altitude inland and in the larger and more complex mountainous systems, as strong winds reduce tree growth. Strong winds take away the sparse soils by erosion,[121] and also damage branches and twigs.[121] The process in which a strong wind downs or uproots trees is called uprooting by the wind. This is most common on the windward slopes, affecting especially the trunks of 75 years or more.[2] Plants that live near the coast, such as the Sceitka spruce, and the sea vine [121] and near the windy slopes of the winds.[1]

"In coastal regions, sea and land breezes can be important factors in the prevailing winds of a place. The sea is heated by the sun more slowly due to the specific heat of the water, higher than that of the earth.[40] As the temperature of the earth's surface increases, this heats the air above it by conduction. Warm air is less dense than the surrounding medium, so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2 millibars between the sea and the land. The cooler air from the sea, which now has a higher pressure at sea level, flows into the earth's breeze, creating a calmer sea-to-to-to-surface intensity (15 km) than the sea-to-to-surface intensity is directly proportional to the greater sea-to-to-to-surface intensity.

Various groups of the same category can be grouped together to form one of higher category, thus constructing a taxonomic hierarchy. The main categories are the domain, kingdom, phylum, branching or division, class, order, family, species, and modern species. The modern nomenclature of Carline is considered by its founder system of taxonomy as well as in its founder.

"The code of bacteria already has a central register of names: all valid names of bacteria are currently published in a single journal, with a new starting date for nomenclature set in 1980.[49] Similar reforms can be expected in the codes of macroorganisms, but zoologists and botanists still have to ratify the proposals. The possibility that a few specialists could monopolize the nomenclature was one of the concerns that led botanists to reject the proposal for a central register of names at the International Botanical Congress in 1999. Similar proposals were rejected at the International Congress of Zoology in the same year. In addition, since many changes were due to differences in the concept of species rather than to confusion over the priority of identification or the stability of names, it was still unlikely that they would have a unique record.

"It is also necessary to question the future of uncategorized taxonomy and the PhyloCode,[51] created a few years ago. Those who support it hope to replace the Linnean nomenclature, based on taxonomic categories, with a one-inomial system to name clades. This approach would eliminate the difficult debate over which clades constitute a taxon with a corresponding name and taxonomic category. The PhyloCode did not come to discuss the debate about a unitary taxonomy, based on at least in 2003.[45] On the other hand, modern classification systems based on molecular DNA analysis (such as APG II or Smith's), et al., and the whole, and use the proposed nomenclatures for the future order LhyloCode, may not have been assigned to the ""species"" in the class.

"The formal description and typification of taxa are procedures in which it is common to observe errors and inconsistencies, and this happened even more before international codes regulated these procedures in great detail. The names of taxa can change when older descriptions of the same taxon are rediscovered, and the principle of priority is applied, or when it is observed that the original description actually referred to a different taxon. The rules of nomenclature indicate that in these cases it is necessary to change the name of the taxon without discussion, but, if by the extension of the use of the name seems desirable to preserve it, a formal proposition must be promoted before the corresponding committee of the International Congress. This may decide to accept the inclusion-neandamin in poor case, the groups has been studied, and the most likely to give the most complicated reasons for the deletion of the names of these types to be given.

During springtime they usually fight with other musk rats for territory or potential couples, and many are injured or killed during these battles. Musk rats families build burrows to protect themselves and their young from cold and predators. In streams, ponds or lakes, the muskrats dig on the shore, and the burrow has an underwater entrance. These entrances measure between 15 and 20 cm wide. In the swamps burrows they build burrows with mud and mud.

They do not store food for the winter, but sometimes they are forced to eat the inside of the burrow.

In Central Europe, the mating season is generally the period from March to September, but also pregnant females or youngs have been observed during the winter months. Usually, in Central Europe females give birth to two litters per year; in very favorable environmental conditions, a third is possible. The gestation lasts thirty days, at the end of which are born between four and nine young, more usually five or six. The offspring are born, small, blind and bald, and weigh only 22 grams.[5] The average age of the animals begins in the first four months of ripe.

"The cosine theorem did not evolve beyond Euclid's two theorems until the development of modern trigonometry in the Middle Ages by Muslim mathematicians.[4] Astronomer and mathematician al-Battani generalized Euclid's result to spherical geometry at the beginning of the 10th century, this allowed him to calculate the angular distance between stars. During the 15th century, al-Kashi of Samarkand calculated trigonometric tables of great accuracy and presented the theorem in a form suitable for triangulation.[5] In French, the cosine theorem is still known as Al-Kashi's theorem.

It was probably a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt before.[84] It is close enough to Neptune to have synchronous rotation, and, within about 3.600 million years of decay, will pass the Roche object, which will never become the estimated temperature of the Sun's Triton.[86] The Sun's star will become the most in the Sun's atmosphere.[86]

The polygonal vault belonged to the chapel of the Old Kings that was a little separated. With this division, the presbytery was a little narrow and not suitable for the cathedral. Cardinal Cisneros was very clear that this part of the building had to be rebuilt and after some clashes with the cathedral chapter he could demolish the one of the Old Kings, make the presbytery more extensive and give enough space to place in the large Gothic altarpiece that he had himself commissioned.[5] Everything is done with the presbytery and worked with all the figures of cy.

"Composed between 1920 and 1924, Król Roger was the second opera by Szymanowski and was born from a trip of the composer to Sicily and North Africa. Szymanowski was impressed especially from Sicily and the way in which in this place elements from cultures as disparate and close as the Greek, Arabic, Byzantine, Roman, Norman and Christian could be mixed. The most attractive thing for the Polish musician was that in the 12th century at the court of Roger II of Sicily (1095-1154), which has happened in history as one of the most tolerant circles of Europe of the time, could live individuals in the same society with such different religious beliefs is the ideal that gave the sensuality of the book and the sensitivity of the interior [citation].

"Roger gives orders to lead before him the shepherd, very beautiful and mysterious young man, who in dialogue with the king shows a disturbing pride. Roger silences the people who insult him and the shepherd describes with great sweetness his god, who seeks the lost herds with his head crowned with ivy and grapes in his hands, able to satisfy the desires of his faithful. Edrisi asks for mercy for the young man, just like Roksana, and Roger, after a moment of anger in which he orders the shepherd to be dead, decides to release him. The shepherd looks at the king's eyes with a luminous smile, and before he leaves, suddenly, Roger, that night, orders him to appear at his palace, where he will be judged.

It seems that it derives from Xystus, the original version of the name of the first three popes named as such, and the one that appears in the earliest documentation.[5] Like most popes of the 1st and 2nd centuries, Xystus is also a name of Greek origin.[7] Philip Schaff notes that Sixtus was a deformation of the original name, as pronounced by the Romans in Latin. Anura Gurugé, on the other hand, indicates that the Greek name derives from xustos, meaning ""skin"" or ""polished"". Maxwell-Stuart adds that it also means ""shaving"", something that may have indicated a personal peculiarity.[9] This word is also used in context to refer to the air of Rome's being born with its free name.[10] Although it,[10]

In this he was influenced by Stravinsky, as he had been deeply impressed with the end of the Psalm Symphony, which he wanted to emulate in this work.[59] Shostakovich's's orthodox theme would not have been extended to the fourfold, and orthodox depiction of the work would have been ""alted to at least by the most.""[61]

At night, however, they often lie on the ground. When they rest, as when grooming to each other, zebras are put next to each other, but vice versa, that is, each zebra has its head on the back side of the other zebra.[4] This has several advantages: on the one hand, it allows the tail of a zebra to scare away the flies from the face of the other; on the other hand, it offers the animals a 360° angle of view.[5]

"The organization process was the same as in his previous soundtrack project More; Schroeder gave them a final edition of the film, explained the subject matter and indicated where the music would go. The recording studio had 16 tracks, which Pink Floyd took advantage of to experiment with musical ideas and recording techniques. This experimentation, which had already begun in Meddle and which continued in this soundtrack, ended up becoming consolidated in The Dark Side of the Moon, an album that consolidated its catalog forever.[6] The album was composed and recorded in just two weeks in France.

"The local critic of the Giornalle delle Due Sicilie had anticipated a hostile climate, wondering whether Rossini would remain within the limits of Ricciardo and Zoraide, both dear to the ""true music lovers"", or whether on the contrary he would give free rein to his imagination. For the newspaper, imagination was equivalent to the influence of German ""degenerate"" music, thus making him responsible for the decline of Italian music.

"Since the nuclear membrane is impermeable to most molecules, nuclear pores are needed to allow the movement of molecules through the envelope. These pores cross both membranes, offering a channel that allows the free movement of small molecules and ions. The movement of larger molecules, such as proteins, is well controlled, and requires active transport regulated by carrier proteins. Nuclear transport is essential for cellular functioning, as movement through the pores is necessary both for gene expression and for the maintenance of chromosomes.

"Newly synthesized RNA molecules are known as primary transcripts or pre-mRNAs. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; the mRNA that appears in the nucleus without these modifications is degraded instead of being used for translation. The three main modifications are the 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. Inside the nucleus, the pre-mRNA is associated with a number of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPhn).

"X-ray diffraction occurs because this electromagnetic radiation has very short wavelengths, between 10 nm and 100 pm, comparable to interatomic distances to crystals (in nickel this is D = 215 p m {\displaystyle D=215\;pm} ). In this case a dispersion occurs in a specular way, by reflection, by the atoms of the crystal, and the different diffraction rays interfere with constructive and destructive interferences. The former reinforce the intensity of the beam and the latter cancel it.[16]

In the two-dimensional functional space V consisting of all the solutions of this equation, the sine function is the only solution that satisfies the initial conditions y(0) = 0 and y′(0) = 1, and the cosine function is the only solution that satisfies the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y′(0) = 0. Since the sine and cosine functions are linearly independent, together they form a basis of V. This method of defining the sine and cosine functions, is essentially equivalent to using Euler's formula. (See: Linear differential equation).

This subject is usually complemented by other themes (contrasubjects) that usually sound simultaneously with the subject. Depending on how many counter-subjects they may sound at the same time with the subject, it is said that a fugue contains double counterpoint (if there is one), triple (if there are two) or quadruple (if there are three). It is for this reason that the fugue is usually related to the multiple counterpoint.[4] While the double and triple counterpoint are more common, the counterpoint requires a virtuosophistic beauty:

Historically, their skin was used to make armor for Chinese soldiers and some tribes in Vietnam believed that skin could be used to produce an antidote for snake poison.[27] Because the distribution of the rhino covers many poor areas, it has been difficult to convince the inhabitants not to kill this seemingly useless animal for selling a large amount of money from the Javanocene horns.[23] When the Javane horns are sold in total value of the Javanocene horns, the Javane [23] of the Javane horns.

However, if humans approach it too much, the Javan rhinoceros becomes aggressive and attacks, nailing the incisors of the lower jaw while doing soarse with the head.[26] Its relatively anti-social adaptation may be the other populations, as evidence was that the more ancient evidence for this species.[10]

"Habitat loss due to agriculture has also contributed to its decline, although this is no longer such a significant factor, as the rhinoceros lives only in two nationally protected parks. The deterioration of habitats has hindered the recovery of rhino populations that had been victims of poaching. Even with all efforts being made to protect it, the survival forecasts of the rhinoceros are poor. Since populations are limited to two small areas, they are very vulnerable to disease and to inbreeding problems. Conservation geneticists estimate that a population of centrhinoceros would be needed to preserve the species’s genetics.[21]

"In 1880, Auguste Vaucorbeil, director of the Paris Opera, delivered a libretto to Saint-Saëns originally intended for Gounod: The English-based schism based on the work of Calderón de la Barca.[6] While working on the work he was elected, in 1881, to be a member of the Academy of Fine Arts.[7] Evidence for the work began in the autumn of 1882. Saint-Saëns put a remarkable effort into creating Henri VIII, for example he did a remarkable research work in the library of ancient manuscripts of the English Crown to be able to use old songs in the score.[8] Thus, he included an old song found among the original cover, still fully recognizing the original vocal roles that remained.[8]

The passionate intrigue offers the opportunity for a thousand psychological nuances.[5] Based on two plays by Pedro Calderón de la Barca and William Shakespeare, The Schism of Inglaterra (1627) and The Life of Henry VIII (1613), the opera approaches the story of the King of the Six Women, founder of the Church of England, in a very different way from the way the Romantic Rossini and Donizetti did: with historicist eagerness, trying to recreate with fairness the atmosphere and even the musical styles of a formal grand English Renaissance, in which L's operas were so impressively displayed,[10] by the great body of the great meanders.

"Tyrannosauroids were bipedal carnivores, like most theropods, and were characterized by numerous bony characters, especially from the skull and pelvis. At first, tyrannosauroids were small predators endowed with long arms with three fingers. Late Cretaceous genera reached a much larger size, including some of the largest terrestrial predators that have ever existed, but most late genera had relatively small arms with only two fingers.

The disease (called “mucormycosis”) only affects the platypuses of Tasmania and has not been observed in platypuses of the continents. The affected animals may develop ugly skin lesions or ulcers in various parts of the body such as on the back, tail and legs. Mucormycosis can kill the platypus; death is caused by secondary infections and because the ability of their body is affected to maintain the effectiveness of their disease and to the North American species’s disease, but to seek the transmission of their current ornithral disease.[55]

Secondly, he saw that most physical contact took place while running the ball, dribbling it or hitting it, and therefore decided that passes would be the only legal option.

"The return of the Italian provinces of Lombardy and Veneto to the sovereignty of Austria in the spring of 1814 provided a favorable opportunity in Milan for composers of Austro-German origin. Von Winter, Meyerbeer and others capitalized on this. Maometto de Winter premiered at La Scala on 28 January 1817 and was a success that ran for 45 performances with some of the best singers of the time, including Filippo Galli himself, but also with Carolina Bassi and Domenico Donzelli. There is evidence that Rossini saw Von Winter's Maometto at La Scala and greatly admired the seriousness and complexity of music with its origins, the synthesis of its various genres, and the handling of its various horns.[11]

In the case of The Jacobin, this interval was six years. The genesis of the libretto was long and complicated. There was little time for discussions concerning the new opera due to the preparations and joint effort of Dvořák and Červinková in the previous opera Dimitrij. In addition, Dvořák had a series of engagements that consumed a lot of time abroad. Another reason for the delay is that the composer was indecisive on the use of a Czech book with a theme.[8]

"In Paris, Martinů meets the surrealist writer Robert Desnos, who introduces the composer to his circle, where he befriends Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes and Georges Neveux. This encounter is important, since three of Martinů's first four operas are based on libretti by the two writers. Julietta emerges from a play by Neveux, the same that would provide him with the libretto for another opera, later after the second war, but the project did not prosper; it is Plainte contra inconnu (Discussion against unknown).

"Martinů saw the work in Paris in 1932, a year after he had married Charlotte Quenehen.[7] The composer was truly hooked by this strange story with his treatment of the dream. Following the same pattern he had with The Miracles of Mary and later with The Greek Passion and Ariane, Martinů wrote his own libretto, with Neveux's permission. Given his subtitles (both from the opera and its source), one could look for the direct influence of the transcendental work Freud's Dream Interpretation in both; but the truth is that Neveux's fascination (and Martinů's) for the dream world comes from farther away.[5]

"Martinů attracts the listener in a dream with a sound net. The piano and accordion evoke distant sounds, but for most of their rich orchestration reflects the Parisian atmosphere in which it was composed. There is also Czech rigor, especially in the forest evocations of the second act, which suggest the childhood landscape of Martinů, and in fact the work feels like a sort of cross between Pelléas et Mélisande and The Makropoulos case for its embrace between the world of French and Czech sounds. Just as the plot remains unresolved, the musical terrain is always changing too, the score is still anchored by the repeated use of the two 1930s of the great-great artist ""Milford"" that Brian described in the most profoundly biennial view of his works.

"Tracing the origin of the expansion consistently, and using its velocity as observed today, it is possible to determine the date of the formation of the nebula, i.e., the date of the supernova explosion. This calculation yields a date corresponding to several decades after the year 1054. A plausible explanation of this gap would be that the expansion velocity has not always been uniform, but has accelerated after the supernova explosion.[13] This acceleration would be due to the energy of the pulsar that would feed the nebula's magnetic field, which expands and pushes the nebula's filaments outwards.[14]

"Theoretical models of supernova explosions suggest that the progenitor star that created the Crab Nebula may have a mass of between eight and twelve solar masses. Stars with a mass of less than eight solar masses are considered too light to produce supernova explosions, and end their life producing a planetary nebula, while those with more than twelve solar masses produce a nebula with a chemical composition different from that observed in the case of the Crab Nebula.[25] To estimate the mass of the nebula, the total amount of light emitted, given the temperature and density of the nebula, and the mass of light generally required is estimated at between the Sun's mass.[25]

"Multiplying complex numbers with polar notation multiplies the modules and adds the angles. Therefore, to find a complex number that multiplied by itself three times produces a given number, it will be enough to find the real cubic root of the module and divide by three the angle. Since adding 2 π {\displaystyle 2\pi } or 4 π {\displaystyle 4\pi } at an angle returns to the same angle, the result of dividing by three the angle of the initial complex plus these angles will also give a value that corresponds to a cubic root (because then multiplying by three will get the initial angle).

"It is in the religious aspect that the contact and influence that the Phoenicians and Punics generated over the inhabitants of the peninsula is most clearly seen; thus, gods, temples and rituals spread very quickly, and have survived to this day. However, the beliefs of the people, although they can change, demand a feeling that is difficult to modify. It is true that during the Carthaginian occupation it can be appreciated how much of the indigenous people believed in Eastern gods or Phoenician myths, but it could be rather a consequence of the constant maintenance of relations with the previous colonies, than for effective control of the territory during the period from 237 to 206 BC.[7]

Lloyd et al. argued that this apparent diversification was an illusion caused by a sampling bias, as the Late Cretaceous rocks have been studied very intensively. Instead, dinosaurs experienced only two significant diversions in the Late Cretaceous, the initial radiations of euhadrosaurs and ceratopsians. In the Middle Cretaceous, flowering angiosperms became a key element of terrestrial ecosystems, which had previously been dominated by gymnines, most of which were now diversified to the fossilized dinosaurs, and herbivores.[33] Meanwhile, they rapidly diversified to the extinctions of the dinosaurs of the dinosaurs, and the dinosaurs of the dinosaurs, they were found in the animals.

"The pontificate is located approximately between 97/99 and 105/107. The Annuario Pontificio grants his mandate the period of 97–105 by convention. As bishop of Rome, the Catholic Church considers him pope, but this title was not adopted until later and Evarist was probably only a priest or a prominent leader of the church. In his period, the ecclesiastical hierarchy was not marked and the bishop of Rome was not the highest authority. Even so, he reigned in a new era, during which the Christian faithful from paganism grew progressively, rather than from Judaism.

"Evarist is the first bishop of Rome, theoretically, from which there are no confusions of order in the list of episcopal succession, nor are there any duplications, as in the case of Anacletus. Therefore, from him, the lists of ancient authors follow the same successional order. In the 2nd-century papal catalogues, used by Irenaeus of Lyons and Hippolytus of Rome, he appears as the fourth successor to the apostle Saint Peter.[7] Generally speaking, it is customary to follow the list written by Irenaeus, which is in fact one of the oldest and most reliable authors, making him the immediate successor to Clement I, which, likewise, Anacleus, had succeeded by a single person.[5]

"The ebulliscopic increase or ascent is one of the colligative properties and, like the rest of these properties, the magnitude of the ascent depends only on the nature of the solvent and the dissolved amount of the solute, i.e., it is independent of the nature of the solute. In other words, any solute, in the same amount, produces the same effect.[1][2][3] In the attached figure the phase diagram of the water is represented. An aqueous solution experiences a decrease in the vapor pressure of the liquid, which results in an increase in the boiling temperature, since more is needed because the vapor pressure of the solution equals the atmospheric pressure.[1]

"One of the practical situations in which it is necessary to know the relationship that exists between the concentration of solutes and the boiling temperature of the solvent is to make designs or modelizations of the operation of an evaporator. The speed of heat transmission in an evaporator depends, among other factors, on the difference between the condensation temperature of the vapor and the boiling temperature of the solution that must be concentrated. According to the ebulliscopic rise, the more concentrated a solution, the higher its boiling temperature. As the concentration increases within the evaporator, the rate of heat transmission decreases. This should be taken into account at the same time of the evaporation graphs, which allow for the evaporation pressures to be [13]

"On the one hand, entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. Thus, a pure liquid is more ordered than a pure vapor, and this has more entropy, more disorder. The disorder is due to the fact that the particles (molecules, atoms or ions) of a liquid are very close together and move slowly. On the contrary, in a vapor the particles are in rapid motion and are not in contact with the others. A liquid solution has more disorder than a pure liquid, since in the solution, in addition to the particles of the solvent in motion, there are also the particles of the solute in motion, which makes the system more orderly fruit. It is evident if you find it and it is in the same way that it is ordered with the other box and only with the more taronges that it contains the more than one.

"Early research on eubullioscopic rise is related to studies on the decrease in vapor pressure of solutions and other colligative properties and is due to scientists such as Michael Faraday (1822), Griffiths and Legrand. Then, in 1847, the German Lambert Heinrich von Babo discovered that the decrease in vapor pressure is independent of temperature and is proportional to the amount of solute. Also the German Friedrich Wüllner, between 1858 and 1860, related the decrease in vapor pressure to the molar concentration of dissolved salts in water.[5]

In total, if the dissociation is complete, for each dissolved mole 3 are formed in solution and the collective property would increase by three times. In solution, therefore, there are more particles than the dissolved ones initially because part of these have dissociated into ions.[2] However, the electrolytes do not dissociate completely, only partially, and it is necessary to determine what the degree of dissociation is in order to calculate the Van't Hoff factor.

"Rossini composed four operas in 1819. Bianca e Falliero is the most conservative of them all, the other three were more dramatic and formal. Here he uses the secco recitative for most dialogues, and adds orchestral accompaniment only for dramatic emphasis. The orchestrations, however, are sensitive, with special attention to the effects of various timbres and motifs of the orchestra on the accompaniment. His use of the choir is extensive, is heavily involved in the action of the drama and forms an integral part of all the great musical numbers. This emphasis on the choir adds sumptuosity to the overall vocal language, which is highly adorned and full of nuances and delicate language.

"With Bianca e Falliero it turns to fragmented and dispersed works. The theme was taken from Il conte Carmagnola, by Manzoni, and although the libretto was provided by Felice Romani, the leading librettist at La Scala, it did not turn out to be a better libretto.[2] The story is set in the 17th century in Venice in a period of conflict with Spain. Unlike the French melodrama Blanche et Montcassin by Arnault, aware of the censors of Milan, Romani put forward a happy ending.[3] It is not clear whether the tragic ending change was for reasons of censorship by the Austrian government or for purely virtuoso artistic desire requirements, such as allowing the finale of Sanpetonnaise (the usual) to be inserted into the finale of the fire.[4]

"The theory of disputed markets was first mentioned by William Baumol, Jhon Panza and Robert Willing in 1982 under the name ""Constestable Market and the Theory of Industry Structure"".[6] This theory tries to demonstrate that a monopolistic or oligopolistic market can be quite similar to a competitive market structure. It is based on the idea that a company in a monopoly situation is threatened by potential competitors, candidates to enter the market, being able at any time to end its dominant market position. So that this does not happen, considering that it does not conduct legitimate practices, it has no choice of taking a more marginal market advantage, and thus causing it to reduce its market price, and thus greatly reducing the market price.[7]

Subsurface lines are lines that were built at shallow depth, about 5 meters away, as the ""cut-and-cover"" method of construction was used, meaning that they were dug outdoors and then buried building a false tunnel. The deep-level lines, also called ""Tube lines"", are lines that are at a depth of about 20 meters or more and were built using the shield tunnel method and where each track has its own tunnel.

Both the Sioux and Crow scouts who had worked for the army, and Curtis' observations on the terrain of the battle, disproved the official legend that Custer appeared as a hero.[4] However, in making his discoveries public he found the rejection not only of the general's widow, but also of the army, public opinion and even of President Theodore Roosvelt, who had sponsored his work.[5]

"Cats generally snore to express dependence;[6] cats depend on the mother and her milk, or on the human when she asks for help or caresses. Snoring plays an important role in the social relationships of cats, as it communicates the state of the cat in their human or cat environment; thus, a snoring cat informs its mother of the fact that it is well and adult cats express happiness when caressed. This vocalization could also strengthen social bonds and disable conflicts (cats snore when they find a dominant cat). According to Turner and Bateson, the role of snoring can be compared to humans in smile.[12] This may also be suggested by a snoring cat, for example.

"In zoology, snoring is a vocalization emitted by some cats and viverrids. This low frequency sound is produced both at expiration and inspiration and appears from the two days of life.

Differentiation requires stimulation by the Colony Stimulator Factor (CSF)-1.[41] They have a morphology and function similar to those of macrophages.[42] Langerine protein, also present in other dendritic cells,[43] is found in Langerhans cells.[44] Recent research suggests that this protein could play a special role in this type of virus, thus making the anti-infected anti-inating body of the anti-infected Langerin cells a ""natural point""[45] and preventing Langerine from being transmitted to the outside of the body.[45]

"Immature dendritic cells are characterized by their high endocytic activity and low activation potential of T cells. They are dedicated to constantly scanning the environment around them in search of pathogens such as viruses or bacteria. They do this by means of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and Toll-type receptors (TLRs). TLRs recognize specific chemical signatures found in subsets of pathogens. Here dendritic cells can also phagocytize small amounts of membranes from living own cells, in a process called nibbling. Once they have come into contact with a present antigen, they are active in the flow of cells that are graded to the same cell and they are able to regulate the metabolic cells, thus by the T cell's' pathogenic membranes, and T cell's' pathogenic membranes.

The fishermen, to continue to exercise their trade, had to emigrate and rent to the boats of the neighboring towns. The population had declined significantly, but nevertheless the fiscal pressure remained, so that each neighbor had to pay more; this caused a vicious circle of emigration and taxation that ended up almost completely populating the town.

And it is because of its context, because it is based on real events and because it is placed in the most plausible images of this current current. And without having to run much imagination, in the first scene it shows a closed area exulting of well-being with the counterweight of another reality –the disadvantaged social world – overwhelming.

Thus, although the size of the tail reaches such a point that it begins to be an unfavourable trait for the species, this will no longer matter.

"This evolutionary mechanism is directly related to sexual dimorphism and the presence of exaggerated morphological traits. Many of these morphological traits lead to a decrease in the adaptive and survival capacities of the animals that possess them. To explain their development, within sexual selection, two hypotheses are postulated called ""Fisher's"" and ""disabled"", conceived by Ronald Fisher and Amotz Zahavi respectively. The first explains this exaggerated development of the physiological structures in one sex by the direct identification of these with higher genomes by their sexual partners. The second hypothesis indicates that the presence of exaggerated morphological traits hinder the survival of the organisms that they were able to feel [3].

"Interestingly, a schoolteacher, on the other hand quite irrelevant to the story, often used by the other characters to tell him things that could perfectly tell each other.[5] The best moments are the choral scenes, which describe the peasant environment in the best way. In the second act the composer uses two opposing choirs - one inside the house of Gianni and the other the peasants who are outside, on the farm of Giacomo-. In this stage of the choirs, he highlights a rather humorous effect, when one of the two brothers confronted by the control of a plot asks the teacher to celebrate his song with a poor success.

The fact that Erckmann and Chatrian's work had been well received was certainly an additional attraction. The conversion of the work into a libretto was met with several problems, the first is its plot: its four acts proved too heavy for such a fragile story: while Mascagni is comfortable in this idyllic climate, the characters are drawn, the passions are latent and there is a certain fall in realism.[4]

"Opinions on Armida are divergent. Rossini’s biographers generally consider it a successful work, even though it does not belong to the composer’s greatest achievements. Rossini made it hastily and not everywhere had a good inventiveness. It also reloads the virtuous singing feats designed for Isabella Colbran and three great tenors: Nozzariego, Bonoldiego and Ciccimary. The choirs sing conventionally, and the ballet music is not very interesting. However, there are excellent passages in the opera, such as love duos. You can see further progress in the technique: Particularly interesting is the original bill of impact from a new Armida’s to the same rhythmicity, and the sound of the same.[12]

They are characterized by a careful stuccoed exterior and courtyards. They are buildings with a certain touch of Sezession: a simple arrangement and a decorative saving new until then in his work.

"In Britten’s opera, Grimes remains a marginal character, but at the same time, he is a executioner and victim in a hostile and uneducated society. The other great protagonist of Britten’s opera is the sea. However, Peter Grimes’ sea is completely different from Debussy’s dazzling marine prodigy. The sea on the English coast is foggy and threatening. With this fatal element the citizens want nothing to see. As a consequence, they reject, both in nature and in human society, everything unclassifiable, uncomfortable, the anomalous, features that Peter Grimes possesses to a great extent.

Britten worked on the work between 1943 and 1945. The libretto is an extraordinarily solid and dense work in terms of the atmosphere; it is a brilliant description of the oppressive atmosphere of the people, always surrounded by the fragrance of the sea; a people in which men cannot approach each other, however much they wish in the depths of his heart.

"This antithetical concept of acute vocal virtuosity was manifested by the concession to mezzo-soprano of an importance that elevated it from the traditional secondary roles (friend, confidant, woman, rival of lesser size), to the main characters, formerly played by the soprano. Since Carmen de Bizet it is no longer unusual that mezzo or contralto assume the leading role -the Rossini mezzo are of different human and vocal nature- and the heroine of the opera no longer has to be angelic. Dalila, with its evil character, confirms this theory and will open the way to other important characters with a serious voice.

The following year, Mascagni contributed to it with this second title, with a triumphal result for the public at the time that he saw himself as the most promising composer of the younger generation. His first piece had been widely admired, but Mascagni wanted to rule out that the reputation of Cavalleria was too focused on the libretto and history, and that he eventually watered down his entrance as a composer.[5] To avoid comparison with the previous work, Mascagni decisively changed the realistic poetry and preferred the tradition of librical, sentimental commedia.

Critics saw in Aureliano a minor opera (especially in comparison to the enthusiastically received Tancredi) and it fell into oblivion from 1830, until the 1980 Renaissance in Genoa. The decline of this opera was also accelerated by the success of Il Barbiere di Siviglia, in which Rossini recycles significant parts of Aureliano, most notably the overture, which seems to be much better suited to an ancient setting than to Rome’s.[2]

Mendeleev indicated that these experiments were performed above absolute boiling temperatures and that to liquefy the gas needed, in addition to increase the pressure, also to decrease the temperature. In 1861 he published a paper on all of this in German[16] and in some of the same study of liquid cohesion, which was published by Thomas Meneliev,[1] and which was called the most critical temperature of the chemical reactions.

"For any circle with radius r and diameter d = 2r, the perimeter is πd and the area is πr2. In addition, π appears in formulas of areas and volumes of many other geometric shapes based on circles, such as ellipses, Cons spheres, and torus.[44] Consequently, π appears on definite integrals that calculate the perimeter, area or volume of shapes generated by circles. In the most elementary case, half of the area of the unit circle is given by:[45]

"The fact that this ratio is constant, regardless of the size of the circle, is what allows π to be defined. For example, if a circle has a diameter double that another also has a double perimeter, therefore the quotient between the two magnitudes is the same. This is a consequence of the properties of the similar figures. Euclid states that in similar figures all distances between homologous points have the same proportion.[23]

"In addition, π is also a transcendental number, as proved by Ferdinand von Lindemann in 1882 and as a consequence of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem. This means that there is no polynomial with rational coefficients such that π is one of its roots.[37] An important consequence of the fact that π is transcendental is that it is not constructible. Since the coordinates of all points that can be constructed with compass and straightedge are constructible numbers, it is impossible to square the circle: that is, using only compass and straightedge, to construct a square such that its area is equal to the area of a given circle.[38] Historically, this is so easy to understand that the remaining geometry element of the remaining squares remained.

"The ancient geometers of Egypt, Babylonia, India and Greece were already aware of the fact that the ratio between the perimeter and the diameter is a constant for all circles and that it is slightly greater than 3. The oldest known approximations date back to 1900 BC; they are 25/8 (Babylonia) and 256/81 (Ancient Egypt), both with an error of less than 1% of the actual value.[3] The Indian text Shatapatha Brahmana assigns to π the value 339/108 ≈ 3.139.[4] The Bible seems to suggest, in the First Book of Kings, that π = 3, on the other hand a clearly bad estimate of others more than was written in the 600 BCE.[5] The passage is controversial in this passage.[5]

"The earliest extant reference to ninja in black is found in an 1801 book illustration where a ninja is observed climbing a castle.[51] One aspect that should be noted is that probably from this representation comes the current image of ninja clothing, which most likely derived from a very recurring artistic convention in Japan, especially in the bunraku, where wearing a black puppet gave the idea to the viewer that he could not see it.[51] The puppeteers themselves use clothes such as those described for the same purpose.[52] However, it is not surprising that during nighttime raids, ideally Japan's, would be preferable to wear the colors of the dark dark dark clouds,[51] and the dark dark dark dark clouds of the winters.[54]

As this sword could be used both offensively and defensively, there was no need to use any kind of shield and this made it easier for these warriors to travel more lightly.[55] Unlike the samurai who used to wear it on the belt, due to mobility required by the shinobi, the sword was carried on the back, with the Tsuka (hank) close to the gold and the left bead to the bend.[55]

"Helium fusion reactions are extraordinarily sensitive to temperature, with reaction rates proportional to T40 (under relatively low temperatures).[26] This means that only a growth of 2% of the temperature increases more than twice the reaction rate. These conditions make the star very unstable; a small increase in temperature causes a rapid increase in reaction rates, which releases a large amount of energy, further increasing the temperature. The helium-burning layer expands rapidly and therefore cools, which reduces the reaction rate again.[27] Large pulsations are created that can be large enough to project the entire star's atmosphere into space.[27]

"The enormous variety of shapes is partly the effect of projection; the same nebula when observed under different angles will look different. However, the reason for the enormous variety of physical forms is not fully understood,[42] although it could be caused by gravitational interactions with companion stars if the central stars are double stars. Another possibility is that the planets disrupt the flow of material from the star when the nebula is formed.[44] It has been determined that more massive stars produce nebulae of more irregular shapes. In January 2005, astronomers announced the first detection of magnetic fields around the central stars of two nebulae planets,[45] and announced that they could be partially responsible for their currents.[45]

Large discrepancies are sometimes observed between the results derived from the two methods.

"Lactates and phosphates (very common salts in whey) help maintain the acid-base balance and greatly influence the properties of whey (stability and thermal precipitation).[40] Whey has a low proportion of proteins, but these have a higher nutritional quality than cheese caseins. Excessive production of whey in making cheese has always been a concern and many ways have been invented to take advantage of it. One of the simplest, home-type, is to heat it to precipitate the proteins, and then press it or filter it. In many populations of Mexico it is usually eaten immediately after filling it with salt (when disturbed by the nutrition),[41] During the release of its nutritive properties to the hydration.

"The Church of the Counter-Reformation promoted a very authentic type of religious art with which attempts were made to counter the threat of Protestantism. In this way, the artificial conventions of the Mannerists who had dominated art for almost a century, were no longer the most appropriate. The two most important features of Mannerism were the rejection of the norms and the commitment to freedom in the composition, in the colors and in the forms. The novelty of the Caravaggists was a radical naturalism that combined the detailed physical observation and the chiaroscuro, the use of light and shadows, an even theatrical and dramatic resource.

While the portraits stand out for their expressive pathos,[23] the facial traits of women strongly resemble each other.[14] This indicates that although Van der Weyden did not adhere to the tradition of idealized representation, he sought to please his models in a way that reflected the contemporary ideals of the majority of the beauty of the noblemen, and painters of the noblemen of van dermanned nature.[24] Wey-d the van van derbula (including the noblemen's's's),[citation needed] and van der van dermanned depictions of the noblemanship of nature.

"Already in 1735, Carl von Linné grouped in his Systema Naturae all rodents in the order Glires, together with the lagomorphs. This group also contained the musks, the opossums, the rhinoceros, the rats-pinyadas, the ai-ais and sometimes other groups of unrelated mammals. From 1821 the term Rodentia was applied by the order that grouped the rodents and the lagomorphs. Based on the different configuration of its masticatory musculature, the group was subdivided in 1855 into sciomorphic, mytric, and the first mygomorphic groups were separated in the current stigomorphic order. The sthid rodents were still separated in the three closely related groups, and the surgical ones in the segomorphic order.

"Těsnohlídek was a Czech narrator who achieved with this text something similar to a Slavic version of A Midsummer Night's Dream.

The tone is naive, the animals do not behave ""humanly"" as in the tale, but always in an animal form, that is, in a simple, cunning, rational way, without ulterior motives.

Ironically, shortly after, the king would rise to the scaffold accused also of treason to the homeland, as the sons of Brutus, and with the artist's vote in the National Assembly, which supported the execution of Louis XVI. It is not known exactly why he did so, since it seems that he should have more opportunities in the service of a king than in the social context of the new order; some authors suggest that David's love for classicism made him embrace everything that was part of that period, including the arrival of a republican government.[5]

"Dorudon is not a transitional species, but it has a combination of physical characteristics typical of its terrestrial ancestors and features characteristic of modern whales. For example, unlike modern whales, Basilosaurus had a well-developed jaw with forty-two sharp teeth. The front ones were cone-shaped and specialized in trapping prey, while the rear ones were triangular in shape and adapted to tear meat, similar to the mesonychids. For this reason, these were long considered ancestors of basilosaurids.[5] Cetaceans are now thought to share a common ancestor with artiodactylids.

"Although at first glance it closely resembled a dolphin, it had a number of important differences. It still had small hind legs, which it probably used to better hold on to the couple when copulating. This is one of the reasons why it is thought that Dorudon is closely related to modern cetaceans, but that it is not the direct ancestor. Unlike the protocetids, its precursors, the pelvic bones of Dorudon that were associated with these legs were no longer attached to the spine, so that the sacral vertebrae were very similar to the rest of the vertebrae.

"The French René Descartes, in 1638, pointed to the aether as the transporter of light, and in 1690 the Dutch Christian Huygens, in his wave theory of light, indicated that light can be propagated by waves thanks to the aether and, since light can travel through the vacuum, even the vacuum must be filled with ether.[8] In 1865 the Scottish James Clerk Maxwell theoretically discovered the electromagnetic waves and explained them as oscillations of an electric field and a perpendicular magnetic field. He showed that light is a type of water, so that it requires the movement of the electromagnetic waves, including the medium, where they have to transmit the waves.[9]

"The sensitivity of the interferometer was so high that any small vibration prevented reading. For this reason the device was mounted in a closed room in a basement with heavy stone walls, thus eliminating most thermal and vibrational effects. The vibrations were further reduced by installing the device on a large block of 1.5 m side and 30 cm thick square stone. This block was supported by a wooden ring of 1.5 m outside diameter, 0.7 m in interior diameter, and 0.25 m thick. This ring floated over the mercury contained in a cast iron channel, 16 cm thick, and had to be left to rest in the form of a fast iron channel.

"He was baptized on August 29, 1628 in Granada, in the disappeared parish of San Andrés. His parents were Alonso de Mena, a famous sculptor, and his second wife Juana de Medrano. His first years of learning were with his father, along with other workshop apprentices among whom Pedro Roldán was. In 1646, at the death of his father, Pedro was 18 years old, and took over the workshop. From 1652 he shared the workshop with Alonso Cano; Cano had left Madrid and had returned to Granada to work as a rationer in the cathedral.[1] Thanks to this collaboration, Mena assimilated some of power to develop a new concept of realism and elaborate technique.

"Lagrange uses a less affected path of this weakness. Consider the expression x2 + y2 as the quadratic form associated with the canonical scalar product. This approach considerably expands the list of available tools, those of linear algebra are now available. The situation is not, however, the one most frequently encountered. The scalar product is not defined on a vector space but on the Z2 module. A module is a structure comparable to that of vector space, with the difference that the set of scalars is no longer a field. For modules of this nature, certain results remain true, such as the existence of a basis that offers a simple algebraic expression.

"When any of the above-mentioned rocks is affected by metamorphism, it is transformed into a metamorphic rock. If the original rock has significant amounts of calcite or carbonate, it is common for the metamorphic rock to derive from it as well. The best-known metamorphic rock that presents calcite is marble.[32] Marble is formed from a metamorphism that causes a recrystallization of pre-existing carbonates. The resulting marble presents a blocky-like mosaic of carbonate crystals. The sedimentary structures of the original rock are frequently destroyed, although in some cases they are preserved, and even fossils have been found in marbles. As are more purely marbled rock, the more phylliums will be found in the original carbonate or carbonate rocks.[34]

There is no doubt that Dürer was represented in the resemblance of Christ, not only in his composition, but softened the contours of his face and modified the shape of the nose and the pulses, as well as he enlarged the eyes that he had smaller and intended a little bit of religious beauty.[8] This could not be interpreted as the strength of Christios so much as the uniqueness.

"Romanesque sculpture is generally inserted within the artistic goals of Romanesque art, including communication between the Catholic Church and the faithful, which is the kingdom of God on earth, the temple. Thus, sculpture had a close relationship with architecture, inserting itself in its place as a complementary element, and was primarily devoted to the teaching of biblical scenes with stone reliefs that were understandable to lay believers.

"As for the mode of representation, the objective was not to show the visible reality, but the invisible and untouchable, taking advantage of much of the mimicry of the figures as a means of communication. The main objective was not the volumetric treatment, but the symbolic value of the figures and the content of their message. The proportion between the figures was another secondary factor, the dimensions were made depending more on their hierarchical importance or the available space for the realization of the relief, rather than keeping the relationship that the figures possessed with each other. The bodies were thin, the expressive gestures, and the different elements of the relief were adapted to the architectural space, and even they were almost fitted in small spaces.[10]

"There are several aspects that make Tristan and Isolde a unique work, but the most commented, which is its main subsequent echo in purely musical terms, is that Wagner expanded in his score the possibilities of harmony, increasing the use of chromatic elements and harmonic suspension, which gave way to a new way of conceiving tonal harmony. First he influenced composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss, and later Arnold Schönberg, Alban Berg and Anton Webern, they ended up establishing new precedents for the music that would come in the following decades.

In fact, to compose for the theatres of Venice, Rome and Milan, rightly or unreportedly less ""advanced"" than the Neapolitan scene, Rossini clearly adopted a more classical form.[5] This explains the reintroduction of the symphony's canonical overture (slow introduction, followed by an Allegro in sonata form without development), rather than the more free prelude adopted in Naples and the use of recitativo secco instead of the full orchestra.[5]

"Vandermonde's method was to calculate partial sums of roots, which could be expressed as images of rational functions in symmetric polynomials. This allowed him to calculate their partial sums, then apply a new decomposition of each sum into subsumes and calculate these subsums. With reiterations, there is hope of obtaining the subsumes, each composed of a single root, and of concluding. This method led him to solve the case where n is equal to 11; but a generic method fell out of reach. However, he had solved an 11th degree equation that had no obvious factorization other than that associated with the term (X - 1).[41]

"A 19th-century point of view consists of studying the smallest set of numbers, closed with respect to the four operations and containing at the same time the coefficients and roots of a given equation. This approach is reflected in Galois theory. It offers a necessary and sufficient condition to know if a polynomial equation is solved by the techniques described by the first approach or, otherwise, it must be limited to approximations from analysis. Until the 19th century, the theory of equations is confused with algebra. Fundamentally after the contributions of Galois theory, algebra is widened to take into account new questions. This theory is at the origin of various mathematical fields, such as theory of the rings, even algebraic groups, and even the theory of the rings.

As the step from coefficient 1 to coefficient c is trivial, he limited himself to the equation Xn − 1 = 0, called cyclotomic.[Note 19] The value n could be reduced to the prime numbers, and the resolution of the particular case of n prime number allowed to deduce the solutions in the general case.

"Astronomers define the metallicity of a star as the abundance of chemical elements that have an atomic number higher than helium. This is calculated by means of a spectroscopic analysis of the atmosphere, followed by a comparison with the expected results of computerized stellar models. In the case of IK Pegasi A, the estimated metal abundance is [M/H] = +0.07 ± 0.20. This notation allows the logarithm of the ratio of metal elements (M) to the ratio of hydrogen (H), less the logarithm of the ratio of the metal (as well as the abundance of zero metal equals the value of the Sun's metallic element, which is equivalent to a large metal value of this, however, the ratio of the Sun's element is equivalent to the ratio of the ratio of the metal.[7]

"At some point in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the hydrogen in its core and begin to evolve away from the main sequence, to form a red giant. The size of a red giant can rise to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or more). Once IK Pegasi A has expanded its diameter will exceed the Roche lobe of its companion, forming a gaseous accretion disk around the white dwarf. This gas, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, will end up on the surface of its companion. This massive transfer of matter between the stars will also cause the mutual orbit to be reduced.[41]

"As the hydrogen of the nucleus of the progenitor of IK Pegasi B was consumed, it evolved into a red giant. The inner core contracted until the hydrogen began to burn in the layer that surrounded the helium core. To compensate for this increase in temperature, the outer layer expanded several times its radius as a star core of the main sequence. When the core acquired a temperature and density in which the helium could begin its fusion, this star contracted and became what is known as a horizontal branch star, i.e. belonging to a group of stars that in large horizontal line in the H-R diagram.

"The altarpiece was owned by the municipality of Granollers until in 1917 the MNAC, after a long negotiation, bought the thirteen tables that it currently held.[7] The acquisition process was very complicated, since the sale of the altarpieces was intended to obtain funds to build the hospital of Granollers: this made the price set by its owners the highest that had ever faced the Board of Museums. Having to pay such a high price led to numerous problems and obstacles to fit it into an extraordinary municipal budget.

"Quartz in its pure and impurity-free state is called rock crystal or ""hyalin quartz"".[69] It is totally colorless, as it has no impurities or inclusions that affect its transparency, and is transparent or translucent. Its dichroic refractive index is extremely low with a double-refringence oriented by a single axis, making it an excellent conductor and channeler of light waves. It is found in mountainous regions and alluvial areas around the world. Its molecular stability is used to control the accuracy of electronic circuits due to its resonant behavior.[70] Brazilian pebbles are a subset of the rock form of the quartzed spheres.[71]

"Quartz crystals tend to develop a little faster on z-sided than r-faces. With this statement you might think that z-sided are more extensive than r-faces, but it is totally the opposite. Growth becomes perpendicular to the faces, which is why if one of the faces grows faster its surface is reduced. The r-faces are usually larger and even, sometimes, the z-faces are absent.

From May to November 1900 he worked on it, which should be his best dramatic work and which deserves a place among the best operas of all time. The atmosphere of the first and last act is of high quality, with several reminiscences of Wagner, but it is first and foremost Czech, with a deep and fine sensitivity for true popular art.

"An important aspect of Rusalka's musical creation is his emphasis on the role of nature. Dvořák's love for nature is sufficiently documented in the composer's correspondence and in the memoirs of his contemporaries. While his admiration for the beauty of nature had come out in previous works, he never expresses himself as eloquently as in this opera. Here the concept of ""nature"" is seen in a very complex way: Dvořák does not merely present an image of a magnificent landscape as a mere backdrop of history; it makes him an active participant in the fate of his characters. This idea takes on a concrete form in the long intervals of nature that often illustrates the event of the second of the orchestra, or second (the orchestral's) before the arrival of Pollzzo.

It was an episode of rapid and intense warming (up to 7 °C at high latitudes) lasting less than a hundred thousand years.[6] The thermal maximum caused a great extinction that served to distinguish the Eocene fauna from that of the Paleocene.

"The mining of fluorspar or fluorite began in England around 1775; in the US, economic extraction of the mineral began between 1820 and 1840 in several places at once.[58] Production and extraction increased and was stimulated with the rise of the ceramic, steel, aluminium and chemical industries, especially during the First and Second World Wars. Over time, the uses of fluorine and fluorite began to increase; examples are fluorocarbon (1931) and the use as a catalyst of hydrofluoric acid for the alkylation processes of octane fuels (1942). Also relevant is the use of fluorite in the automobile, which began to separate fluorine from China, and during the fall of other countries, thus limiting fluorine production of fluorine in the production of the hydrocarbons in the year.[58]

They appear to migrate upwards when they are covered by a thin layer of sediments, but this is an illusion caused by the growth of the colony; the individuals themselves do not move. If a layer of sediments is deposited too thick before they can grow or reproduce through it, some parts of the colony will die, leaving fossils with a characteristic wrinkled texture of ""elephant skin"".[18] Most stratiadacarians with the ""elephant skin"" characteristic characteristic of microbial mats, and stratums that are not currently contained significant numbers of these rugs.[19]

"Periods of intense cold have also been suggested as an obstacle to the evolution of multicellular life.[73] The oldest known embryos, from the Doushantuo Formation in China, appear only a million years after Earth emerged from global glaciation, and suggest that a layer of ice and cold oceans may have prevented the emergence of multicellular life. Complex life may have evolved before these glaciations, and that they exterminated it.[73] However, the diversity of life forms in modern Antarctica has created disagreements as to whether cold temperatures increase or slow the rate of evolution.

This threshold or minimum barrier can be expressed in various ways: in percentages on the electoral roll, on the votes cast, on the valid votes or in absolute numbers of votes. In addition, the barrier can be required at the level of constituency, of electoral region or of state.

This is the process of echolocation, a skill they share with dolphins and some whales. There are two groups of nocturnal butterflies capable of countering this weapon of bats: the arctids produce ultrasonic signals to warn bats that are chemically protected (aposematism; it was formerly believed to be a form of radar interference, but this theory has been ruled out), while the noctuids have an ear organ called tympanal that responds to the signal by making bats accidentally deflected, such as letting the executives [24] fall against the execution of the muscles.

"Because they have much thinner wings than those of birds, bats can maneuver much faster and more accurately than birds. The surface of the wings is also equipped with touch-sensitive receptors in small lumps called Merkel cells, present in most mammals. However, these sensitive areas are different in bats, as each lump has a tiny hair in the center,[13] which makes it even more sensitive and allows the bat to detect and collect information about the air flowing over its wings. The wing membrane of species that use the wings to hunt prey has an additional type of receptor cell, which is sensitive to the east when the membrane is concentrated in the cells of the wings.[13]

"Vital functions are slowed down gradually in reaction to different stimuli: the internal clock of bats, the external temperature or the availability of prey. The activity time is shortened and sleep is extended. The beginning of hibernation usually coincides with the fall of the leaves in autumn.[33] The metabolism drops a lot and the heart beats only ten times per minute, in contrast to the 600 ppm of the summer fighters. The low metabolism keeps the organism alive and ensures vital functions. The breathing becomes so tenuous that it is imperceptible and the bats in hibernation can remain dozens of minutes without breathing (1% of the same breathing phase with the ambient temperature).[33]

Vasari says that Bramante secretly introduced him, and the scaffold corresponding to the first finished section was removed in 1511. The reaction of the rest of the artists to Michelangelo's superior expressive strength was the dominant question of Italian art in the next two decades, and Raphael, who had already at that time demonstrated talent in absorbing other influences within his own style, accepted the challenge perhaps better than any other artist. One of the first and clearest examples was Michelangelo's portrait of Heraclitus himself in The School of Athens, directly resembling the paintings of the same art of the same [27] and that Raphael was more personal than the other figures of the same.

This specimen consists of an adult of Psittacosaurus (which has not been assigned to any particular species), which is closely associated with 34 articulated juvenile skeletons, all preserved three-dimensionally. Juvenile Psittacosaurs, all about the same age, intertwine in a group below the adult, although 34 skulls are found above the mass of bodies, as they would have been in life.

"The use of leitmotiv should not be considered an influence of Wagner—which Rimsky-Korsakov knew very little at the time. But although Rimsky-Korsakov had not seen or studied The Ring of the Nibelung when he worked on this opera, he was familiar with Wagner's early works and his theoretical writings.[1] While for Wagner they are the plot on which the orchestral fabric is formed, in Rimsky-Korsakov's writing the leitmotiv are mostly used in voices and sometimes parts of a more or less long theme; such as the main melody of The Maiden of Bereidic and the Tsar-Korsakov-Korsakov-Mel.[10] They are often the more sequences.

Almost all amphibian species are carnivorous in the adult stage, feeding on invertebrates such as arthropods, annelids, and gastropods. Some large species can hunt prey such as small mammals, fish, and smaller amphibians. Some frogs and salamanders use their sticky tongues to hunt fast prey, while others catch it and put it in their mouths with their hands.

Some may have evolved from plasmids (elements of DNA moving between cells), while others may be the result of regression of bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important mechanism of horizontal gene transfer, a phenomenon that increases genetic diversity in a similar way to sexual reproduction.[7] Some biologists see viruses as a way of life because they are carriers of genetic material, reproduce and evolve by natural selection, although they lack several fundamental characteristics that are usually considered indispensable to life, such as a cellular structure.

"Viruses undergo genetic change by various mechanisms. These include a process called genetic drift in which individual bases of DNA or RNA mutate into other bases. Most of these point mutations are imperceptible in that they do not change the protein that encodes the gene, but others may confer evolutionary advantages such as resistance to antiviral drugs.[69] Antigenic change occurs when there is a significant change in the genome of the virus.[71] This happens as a result of genetic recombination or reassortment. When this occurs in influenza viruses, pandemics may result.[70] RNA viruses usually exist as quasi-species or as viruses of the same nucleoside species, but are slightly prominent in the targeting of the natural species.[71]

The nucleoid is surrounded by a membrane and two side bodies of unknown function. The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein on the surface. The particle is usually slightly pleomorphic, with a shape that can range from an egg to that of a brick.[65] Mimivirus is the largest known virus, with a capsid diameter of 400 nm. From its projected surface are 100 nm protein filaments.[66] The hegonal capsid appears in the microscope, which is probably the case.

"In fact, capital increases with moderation ""the immediate cause of the increase in capital, it is the economy, and not industry"",[41] motivated by the constant, uniform and uninterrupted effort of every individual in order to improve their luck.[41] By devoting more funds to productive work, a frugal man's capital implements additional production (in modern terms, savings are equal to investment). Thus, what is saved is equally consumed, but by the others: for productive workers instead of unproductive workers or non-workers, who reproduce the value of their consumption, plus a portion of profit. Conversely, the wastefulness wears their capital and decreases the mass of national labour, even if it decreases the most productive income available, and the most.

"For Smith, currency is not the value itself, and currency accumulation has no economic interest for a country. Currency is increasingly the practical means of measuring the value of transactions, as well as the means of exchanging this value. To accomplish these functions, precious metals are particularly appropriate, as their own value varies little in reasonable time periods. In the long run, wheat is a better pattern. However, precious metals themselves have an important cost, and it is proposed to replace them with the paper-currency, following a strict ratio in order to avoid the issue without compensation. The resulting banking system becomes ""a great kind of airway, giving the country ease to make good land pastures of wheat""[26] and to make good land for its large land.

"Starting in 1300, beginning with Giotto and his followers, still life paintings revived religious-themed paintings in the form of objects of everyday life that accompanied the protagonists.[13] This type of pictorial representation was considered minor until the Renaissance, which is why it appeared in general subordinate to other genres, such as history painting, religious painting or portraiture, often entailing religious or allegorical significance.[14] This was particularly evident in the work of Northern European artists, whose attraction for symbolism and detailed optical realism led them to devote great attention to the general message of their paintings.[14]

"The Virgin Mary is glorified by the Latin words elevated and exalted. Its meaning refers to the position of the Virgin in painting, inside a fortified palace and above the landscape that surrounds it. Her hieratic position and the way she presents the Child Jesus, reflects the traditional representation of the Throne of Wisdom, an iconographic scheme typical of Romanesque art. She seems to look at the cross that is at the top of the globe, prefigured the suffering of her son to the crucifixion.

"In order to apply ROT13 to a part of a text, one only has to examine the alphabetic characters and replace them with the letter 13 positions later in the alphabet, following the principle if necessary.[3] Thus, in the basic Latin alphabet of 26 characters, A becomes N, B becomes O, and so on until M, which becomes Z. Then the sequence continues with the principle of the alphabet: N becomes A, O becomes B, and so on until Z, which becomes M. It is therefore a particular case of the affine cipher. Only the letters that appear in the basic Latin alphabet are affected; numbers, white symbols are not modified in their own, and all letters are modified in reverse:[13]

"ROT13 is not intended to be used when there is concern for message secrecy—the use of a constant rotation means that the cipher does not actually have any key, and decryption does not require any knowledge beyond the fact that ROT13 has been used. Even without this knowledge, the algorithm can be easily broken through frequency analysis.[3] Because of its absolute lack of suitability to maintain a true secret, ROT13 has become a slogan to refer to any clearly weak cipher system: one critic could claim that ""the 56-bit DES system is now little better than ROT13"".[13] In a prank on cryptographical terms such as ROTdoble, ROTOS is already intended to apply to a ""recipherical parody"" of ROTOS, ""eventure"",[13] as the original coded text with ROTOS226 equivalent to ROTOS.

"The Vigenère cipher uses Caesar cipher with a different offset for each position of the text; the value of the shift is defined using a repeating keyword. If the keyword is used only once, it is as long as the message, and is chosen randomly, then it is a Vernam cipher, impossible to decrypt if users keep the key secret (in fact it is the only cipher that has been mathematically proven to be undecryptable). For shorter keys than the message (i.e., by the Vigenère cipher), which was historically used, a cyclic pattern appears in the text that can be detected with the Kasski method and the cipher length, then the crypto key can be defragrammed with the known keystrogram length.[e.]

"In the second example, breaking the cipher is even more direct. Since there is only a limited number of possible shifts (27 in English), they can all be tested in order in an attack by brute force.[14] One way to do this is to write a table in which a piece of text is deciphered with all possible shifts[15] — this technique is sometimes referred to as ""complete the plain component"".[16] The example of the table on the right is for the ciphertext ""JXUJWYEKJWT""; the plain text is instantly recognized by a shift of five. Another way to see is that each alphabet is written in reverse order, and that it can be used in reverse ordering the ciphertext in the order of the letters.

"The colonial disasters of Spain of 1898 led to a crisis of conscience, a state of mind where the spite, shame and contempt of the past mixed with a desire to straighten. While the generation of the 98 wanted to ""Europeanize"" Spain, Unamuno wanted to ""Africanize"".[17] In this context Maragall published his ""three songs of war"": The goodbyes, Ode in Spain and Song of return.[66] Catalanism broke into politics but the old oligarchies were remade and the voice of the regenerators, crying in the desert, went extinct. Maragall expressed in his Oudida Spain for the official Catalan political progress, which originated from Catalan agrarianism.

For example, unlike modern whales, Basilosaurus had a well-developed jaw with 44 sharp teeth. The front ones were cone-shaped and served to catch prey, while the rear ones were triangular in shape and adapted to tear meat, similar to the way mesonychids did. For this reason, the latter were long considered the ancestors of Basilosaurus.[2] Cetaceans are now thought to share a common ancestor with the artiodactylids.

"These densities are possible due to the fact that matter is not composed of normal atoms that can form chemical bonds in the usual way, but is in the plasma state, and nuclei and electrons are not cohesive. Thus, in this state there is no obstacle that prevents atoms from approaching each other, because otherwise it would be impossible to break into the space normally occupied by the atomic orbitals of electrons.[23] Eddington wondered what would happen when this plasma cools down and the energy that keeps the atoms ionized disappears.[37] In 1926, R. H. Fowler solved this paradox by applying the then newly-instated quantum electrons to the same state, which would have been introduced to the other electrons.[39] This means that they would not have met the other electrons in the higher than the absolute absolute state of exclusion, and that they would have been able to possessed electrons.[39]

"In 1947, P. M. S. Blackett predicted that white dwarfs should possess magnetic fields of a force on their surface of about one million gauss (100 teslas), as a consequence of a physical law he proposed, which stated that a rotating and uncharged body should generate a magnetic field proportional to its angular momentum.[68] This theory is called gravitational magnetism, also known as the Blackett effect,[69] which has never been observed or generally accepted by the scientific community.[70], 39–43.

"The calculations assume that the white dwarf does not have rotation. If it had rotation, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium would have to be modified to include centrifugal force by taking a rotating reference system,[49] since for a white dwarf with uniform rotation, the mass limit increases very slightly. However, if the rotation of the star is not uniform, and viscosity is not taken into account, there would be no mass limit for a white dwarf model in static equilibrium, as noted by Fred Hoyle in 1947.&lt;[50] However, not all these rotating star models are dynamically stable.[51]

"An astrometric binary is a binary star in which only one of the stars can be visually observed. The position of the visible star can be measured precisely because an oscillation is detected due to the gravitational influence of its companion. The position of the star is repeatedly measured relative to more distant stars, and then it is checked if periodic displacements of its position are observed. Typically, this type of measurement can only be done with nearby stars, such as those found up to 10 parsecs. Nearby stars often have a high proper motion, and therefore astrometric binaries that appear to follow a sine path through the sky.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme that acts as a hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of different types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrate and reduce NAD+H.

"It is likely that the initial cells were all heterotrophic, using nearby organic molecules (even those of other cells) as raw material and energy source.[22] As food sources were depleted, some cells developed a new strategy. Instead of exploiting the dwindling sources of organic molecules in the free state, these cells adopted sunlight as a source of energy. There are various estimates, but 3,000 million years ago (at 8:00 on our watch),[23] something similar to modern photosynthesis had probably appeared. This meant that solar energy could be used not for the raw materials, but for the abundant carbon dioxide molecules (they, solar energy consumed only by hetrophen).

"Mannerism was the artistic movement produced during the Cinquecento and whose formation occurs in the first decades of the 16th century and extends until the beginning of the 17th century. Perhaps the most dramatic change introduced by Mannerism in painting is the transformation of the notion of space. The rebirth was able to construct the visual representation of space, in a very homogeneous, coherent and logical way, based on the classical perspective and the placement of the characters against a uniform stage and in correspondence with a hierarchy of proportions that simulated with great success the gradual withdrawal from the foreground to the horizon of the background. The Mannerism breaks this unity with different points of absence that coexist in the same relationship with the same and the relative proportions of the main figures [...].

"Uranium 238 is usually an α emitter (occasionally undergoing spontaneous fission) and decays through the ""uranium series"" of nuclear decay, which has 18 members that, in the end, decay to lead-206 through different decay pathways.[10] In addition, uranium-238 is not fissile, but is a fertile isotope, because after neutron activation it can produce plutonium-239, another fissile isotope. In fact, the 238U nucleus can absorb a neutron to produce a radioactive isotope of uranium 239. U-239 is integrated by means of beta decay into a plutonium-239, which is also converted to the first beta-239, which is converted to the first beta-emitting test in the United States of July 1945.[39]

"Uranium 235 was the first isotope to be discovered to be fissile. Other isotopes present in nature are also fissionable, but not fissile. When bombarded with slow neutrons, the uranium 235 isotope almost always divides into two smaller nuclei and releases nuclear bond energy and more neutrons. If many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei then a nuclear chain reaction takes place that results in a heat release or (in special circumstances) in an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, this chain reaction occurs slowly and is controlled by a neutron poison, which absorbs some of the free neutrons that absorb these rods that usually form part of the reactor.

The modern definition of ""first number"" is ""positive integer with exactly two factors"", thus excluding the number 1. This definition may be rationalized to observe that it fits in a more natural way with the first theorems, if one is considered the most fundamental.[9]

"Sperner's lemma is a more advanced application of the same strategy.[16] The lemma states that a certain type of coloration in the triangulation of a simplex has a subsimplex containing all colors. Rather than directly constructing such a subsimplex, it is more convenient to prove that an odd number of subsimplices exists through the method of induction. A stronger statement of the lemma explains why this number is odd: it naturally breaks as (n + 1) + n when considering the two possible orientations of a simplex.[17]

"In the so-called French War, and being part of the Napoleonic Empire, the region of La Seu was included in the French department of the Segre (1812–1814). Once it was liberated, the city showed obvious signs of a predominance of the absolutist faction, such as the other mountain villages that were opposed to liberalism in the Catalan coastal strip. During the Liberal Triennium, in the summer of 1822, it fell into the hands of the absolutist parties of Joan Romagosa and Antonio Marañón, the Trapense, and so the royalists could constitute the Regència d'Urgell, the highest manifestation of the dominant ideology in the area.[1]

"Diurnal lemurs are visible during the day, so they live in groups, where more eyes and ears help to discover possible predators. Diurnal lemurs use and respond to alarm calls, even those of other lemur species and non-predatory bird species. The ring-tailed lemur has different calls and reactions to different predators, such as prey birds, mammals, and snakes.[36] Some, such as the Indri, use a crypsis strategy to camouflage.[74] They are often heard, but are difficult to see among the trees due to clappy light (light and snakes) that have been the ""forests of the forest"".[74]

"Its taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on what concept of species is used. Even the highest-level taxonomy is discussed. Some experts locate most lemurs in the Lemuriformes infraorder, while others believe that this clade contains all existing strepsirrhines, placing all lemurs in the superfamily Lemuroidea and the lorisids and galagids in the superfamily Lorisoidea. They arrived in Madagascar about 62–65 Ma by rafting (in vegetation rafts) at some time when ocean currents favored dispersion to the island.

"Cryoscopic descent is one of the collective properties and, like the rest of these properties, the magnitude of the descent depends only on the relationship between the number of solute particles and those of solvent. Therefore, for a given solvent, very often water, depends only on the number of dissolved solute particles and not on their nature. Any solute, equal to molality, produces the same effect.[2][3][4] For example, the cryoscopic descent produced by adding glucose to a solution is equivalent to that achieved by adding equal mass of fructose instead of glucose, since being of identical mass the number of particles would be added to the same m, despite being of sugar.
