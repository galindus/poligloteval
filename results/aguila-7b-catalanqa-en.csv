"There are many types of plant viruses, but they often only cause a loss of production, and it is not economically viable to try to control them. Plant viruses are often transmitted from one plant to another by organisms known as vectors. They are usually insects, but it has also been shown that some fungi, nematodes and single-celled organisms are vectors. When it is considered economical to control phytovirus infections (in perennial fruits, for example), efforts are concentrated on killing vectors and removing alternative hosts such as weeds.
