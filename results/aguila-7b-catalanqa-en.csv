Plant viruses are often transmitted from one plant to another by organisms known as vectors.

"Although, according to Oort, the number of cloud objects would be about 1011, current estimates give a rather higher number: around 1013 objects, which remain stable because solar radiation is very weak at those distances. When a star passes relatively close to the cloud, the gravitational field of the star modifies the orbits of some objects and launches them into the Solar System. Thus, the cloud provides a continuous source of cometary material that replaces the destroyed comets. Currently, it is estimated that the total mass of comets in the Oort cloud could be about 40 times the mass of the Earth.

"The arrival of World War II delayed all expansion plans. From the mid-1940s the Blitz bombings led to the use of the subway stations as air shelters. The authorities initially tried to prevent the stations from being used as shelters, but later they supplied stretchers, latrines and power services.

Some of these stations became government offices. Some examples are Down Street, which was used as an Executive Office for the University of the United States Air Force (UN) and for the Royal Naval Warfare Committee (now used as the Royal Air Force Board for its executive headquarters; and Royal Naval Air Force; and Naval Air Force Boards; and the University of the Royal Air Force; and the Naval Air Force Board of the University of the United States Air Force; and the United States Air Force; and the United States Air Force; and the Naval Air Force for the Royal Air Force; and the Royal Air Force Board of London Air Force; and the Naval Warfare Board of London Air Force; and the Naval Air Force

"One of the first attempts to determine the Earth's density was made by Le Havre's hydrography professor, Pierre Bouguer, during the Geodesic Mission in Peru (1735-1739). Bouguer conducted several experiments to determine the relationship between the density of the Chimborazo volcano and the average density of the Earth, from the deviation of the vertical of a plumb near this great mountain. Isaac Newton had previously considered the realization of the experiment as a practical demonstration of his theory of gravitation in his Principia, but finally rejected the idea. Bouguer's results were not very good, since he measured a density of the Earth four times the top and the mountain twelve times more.

"There are also experiments that try to demonstrate the theory that some females of some species are able to choose the male with the best genetics without any demonstration by this, considering that the best genetics is that which increases the survival capacity of the offspring. In one of these experiments they took several females from the vinegar fly and were divided into two groups. One of them was forced to mate with a single male taken by the researchers at random while the other was shown to the various male females so that they could mate with what they considered appropriate. Subsequently the offspring of both groups were subjected to predator pressure showing the females who had freedom to mate to take better survival, and that they had not been able to survive from their offspring.

"Of the nearly 400 known specimens of Psittacosaurus, only one has been published with some type of pathology. The specimen in question, which consists of a complete adult skeleton and which has tentatively been assigned to P. mongoliensis, was found in the lower layers of the Yixian Formation, in China. There is no indication of bone fracture, but very clear signs of an infection near the midpoint of the right fibula can be seen. The bone exhibits a large circular hole, evidence of necrosis due to the lack of blood irrigation in the region. The hole is surrounded by a large amount of inflammation less than the third of the difference in the Bepis, and this way the animal would have been responsible for doing so much. However, it would have been the fatal to survive the disease of the Bepis.
